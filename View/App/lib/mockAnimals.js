                "Sookie and Merlotte are former PPNK bottle babies from the True Blood litter, adopted together in 2022 and very loved by their family (including two young kids) for their first 2-1/2 years. A family hardship left no other option but to return these two to their former foster home. Since coming back into foster, they have settled from the trauma of being returned, are well established on a healthier diet, and they are so ready to find their FOREVER home together. They are super bonded with each other, and are confident and loving kitties who want nothing more than ALL the attention from you and each other! They have separate hammocks since they are full grown kids, but often they are piled (literally) into one hammock, barely able to fit (and whoever is the unlucky one under the other, barely able to breathe, lol). \n" +
                "Because these two have only known each other as the one constant throughout their entire lives, we are looking for them to be adopted together to ease their transition to a new home, while also keeping their sibling buddy for life.  For more great reasons to adopt a pair, visit http://www.kittenlady.org/twokittens \n" +
